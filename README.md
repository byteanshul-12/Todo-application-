# Todo-application
I have tried to code the todo application from the scratch using the DOM  manipulation . This Is the code for the simple todo application in which we can add todo , delete Todo and can also update the todo .

//How to add the todo in the dom 

For adding the todo in the dom i have tried to create a <li> element and then tried to append  that in the ol tag using the document.querySelector('').appendChild .

//For Deleting the Todo.. 

For deleting the todo first i have given a unique id to every single todo by declaring the a index variable and assigning new value to it every single time by incrementing it by one
